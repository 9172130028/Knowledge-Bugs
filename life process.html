<h3>The basic life processes common to all living organisms are nutrition,respiration,
    transportation and excretion.</h3>

<h1>Nutrition</h1>
<h3><li type="square">It's is a process by which an organism obtains nutrients from food and utilism them to eletain energy,
     bulding and repairing of their tissues.</h3>

 <h3><li type="square"> Mode of Nutrition- Method of procuring food by an organism. <br>
ex: plants & some bacteria = green pigment (chlorophyll)= photosynthesis.<br>
ex: animals, fungi and other bacteria depende on plants and other organisms for food.</h3>    
<h3>The two main modes of nutrition:</h3>
<h3><ul type=1 start=1>
        <li>Autotrophic Nutrition
            <li>Heterotrophic Nutrition
</ul></h3>
<hr size="5" color="black">
<h2> 1) Autotrophic Nutrition:</h2>
<h3>Some organisms use simple food material obtained from inogranic source in the form of CO2 and H2O. these organisms are termed as autotrophs.
    </h3>
<h3>eg: Green plants and some bacteria.</h3>
<h3><li type="square"> The mood of nutrition in which palnts make their own food is called Autotrophic Nutrition.</li></h3>
<h3><li type="square">
In chemosynthetic mode of nutrition,chemical energy is utilised by the organismsto prepare food.
</li>
</h3>
<h2>Plant Nutrition : Photosynthesis</h2>
<h3><li type="square">
    It is the process by which plant make it own food with help of carbon dioxide, water, chlorophyll and sunlight.
